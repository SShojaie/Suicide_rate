### Introduction

The United Nations (UN) General Assembly adopted a resolution in 2011 that said “the pursuit of happiness is a fundamental human goal” and embodies the spirit of the globally agreed targets known as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). 

It might seem an odd time to start a project about world happiness. After all, how can someone be really happy during a global pandemic? 

But we've all thought that we'd be happier with more cash in our pocket at some point or another; and it's only natural to feel unhappy and stressed when money's tight. This is precisely why now is the right moment to explore readily available data, to be able to analyze trends over time and correlate factors that impact happiness across the world. 

While some would argue that “Rich countries are definitely happier than poor countries,” this project will look into other variables other than a country's economic health.

### Mission

Utilize Python, Pandas, Numpy and Data Visualization tools to answer the following questions: 

+  Does economic health correlate with happiness? 
+  What other factors impact happiness? 
+  How do outlier countries perform within the UN's happiness index variables?
+  How do outlier countires perform with other factors?
+  How does Canada compare with outlier countries? 
+  How does Canada compare to US?
+  Is it changing over time? 

### Data Background

Our primary dataset was derived from the Annual World Happiness Reports published by the UN's Sustainable Development Solutions Network. It is then merged with other data obtained from the GHDx (Global Health Data Exchange) - University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, The World Bank, ... and

### Hypothesis

"Economic Health is not related to happiness"

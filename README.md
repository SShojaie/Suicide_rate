The United Nations through its General Assembly adopted a resolution saying  “the pursuit of happiness is a fundamental human goal” and embodies the spirit of the globally agreed targets known as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). 

It might seem an odd time to work on a project about which countries are the happiest. After all, how can someone be really happy during a global pandemic? 

While some would argue that “Rich countries are definitely happier than poor countries,” this project will look into other variables other than a country's economic health.

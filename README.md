# Introduction

The United Nations through its General Assembly adopted a resolution saying  “the pursuit of happiness is a fundamental human goal” and embodies the spirit of the globally agreed targets known as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). 

It might seem an odd time to work on a project about which countries are the happiest. After all, how can someone be really happy during a global pandemic? 

While some would argue that “Rich countries are definitely happier than poor countries,” this project will look into other variables other than a country's economic health.

# Asks: 
###     - Why is looking at happiness important?
###     - Does economic health impact the level of happiness?    
###     - What else makes people happy?
###     - How does Canada and US compare? 


# Data Background

Our primary dataset is the Annual World Happiness Report published by the United Nations' Sustainable Development Solutions Network, while the other chosen datasets were obtained from GHDx (Global Health Data Exchange) website of the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.  

The World Happiness Report entail the "Happiness Index (Ladder Score)", "Log GDP", "Social Support", "Healthy Life Expectancy", "Freedom", "Perception of Corruption", and "Generosity" variables. It is evident that the higher the value of each of the six related factors means the level of happiness is higher.

On the other hand, the group had indentified and sourced other factors that could also impact happiness such as "Unemployment", "Brain Drain", "Security Index", "Fragile Index", "Poverty", "Corruption", "Physician per Population", "Substance Abuse", "Depression & Anxiety", "Suicide" "Education Spending", "Tourist Arrivals", "Literacy Rate", and "Sleep".
